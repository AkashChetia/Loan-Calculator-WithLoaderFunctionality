# Loan-Calculator-WithLoaderFunctionality
Vanilla JS Project 2

Simple Project based on the functionality of Vanilla Javascript, to make calculations related to loan amount and give broader view of Monthly payment, Total Payment and 
Total Interest. Here i tried to mimic the server run time by adding Gifloader for 2 sec to calculate the results as mentioned above.
